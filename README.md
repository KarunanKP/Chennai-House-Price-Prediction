# Chennai-House-Price-Prediction

Objective:
The objective of this project was to build a machine learning model to predict the sales price of houses in Chennai. This involved exploring the dataset, preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, building regression models, and evaluating their performance.

What I Did:
Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploration.
- Handled missing values by filling null values and dropping other rows with null values, Converted datatype.
- Encoded categorical labels into numeric form using LabelEncoder.
- Split the data into training and testing sets and scaled the features using MinMaxScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized the distribution of houses in various areas of Chennai using pie charts and box plots.
- Explored the relationships between different features and the sales price of houses using Scatter plots, Box plots, and Heat maps.

Model Building and Evaluation:
- Built regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
- Evaluated the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Log Error, R-squared (R^2), and Adjusted R-squared.

Conclusion:
- The project successfully achieved its objective of building a machine learning model to predict house prices in Chennai.
- The models were evaluated based on various metrics, and the top-performing models were XGBoost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Extra Trees Regressor, based on the Adjusted R-squared values.
- This project helped me learn more about machine learning, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation. It also gave me practical experience in using various regression models to predict house prices, which can be valuable for real-world applications.
